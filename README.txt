 •Group members’ names and x500s:
 -I worked alone.

 •Contributions of each partner (if working with a partner):
 -None.

 •How to compile and run your program:
 -In Main.java, click the run program green play button. It will then prompt the player to choose between Easy, Medium, or
 Hard level. After it will ask the player to also choose either Debug or Normal Mode. Then to start the game, the user will
 have to enter their starting coordinates in which the game will manually set mines accordingly. Thereafter, the player will
 continue to enter coordinate guesses to reveal or flag cells. If the user reveals the whole field, they will receive a
 message informing them they have won and the program will end. Likewise, if they hit a bomb, it will inform them that
 they blew up and the game is over.

 •Any assumptions:
 -The program will run properly, under the assumption that the user will type in the coordinates EXACTLY as prompted
format no extra spaces (just the numbers) or anything when asked for user input. Same goes for the initial prompts, assuming
that the user will have capitalization, spacing, and correct spelling, along with choosing a valid option. Additionally, the
user may not unflag a flag, choose out-of-bounds coordinates or an already revealed cell, or flag when there are none remaining
, otherwise they will be re-prompted to enter new valid coordinates. I also did not want to over-complicate and add an extra
block of if/if else statements to space the first cell of the rows 10+ one less space in hard mode.

 •Additional features that you implemented (if applicable):
 -None.

 •Any known bugs or defects in the program:
 None.

 •Any outside sources (aside from course resources) consulted for ideas used in the project, in the format:
 – idea1: None
